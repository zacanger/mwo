# Î≠ê?

Is this thing a file, directory, executable, or what?

--------

## Usage:

`npx mwo [foo]`

You can install it globally, if you really want to, with `npm i -g mwo`.

Currently it works for files (including directories) and things in `$PATH`.

## Roadmap:

* Aliases and functions
* sh/ksh/zsh compat
* Windows, maybe, eventually?
